            What are the causes of climate change?

          <p>
            Burning fossil fuels is a major cause of climate change. We burn these to produce heat, electricity, and it’s also a major energy source. When fossil fuels are burned, carbon dioxide, one of the biggest greenhouse gases, is released into the atmosphere. Any effects of climate change that are under the influence of humans are because of carbon dioxide. Fossil fuels are also nonrenewable, which means that we will eventually run out of them. In fact, at our current rate of fossil fuel usage, we will completely deplete our source by 2060. This is also why renewable energy is important, both in terms of climate change, as well as sustainability.

            A second cause of climate change is deforestation. Trees store carbon in their trunks, which means that when they are cut down, all the carbon is being released back into the atmosphere. This is why when forests are being cut down for agriculture, it releases greenhouse gases, further contributing to climate change. In order to combat this, planting more trees is required so that more carbon will be stored and there will be fewer amounts released into the atmosphere.

           <p>
            Finally, agriculture is another huge cause of climate change. There are various factors to agricultural emissions, but some include emissions from livestock, rice fields, and the burning of biomass. Nitrous oxide is a main gas that is released by agricultural activities. Methane is mainly released from livestock, especially cows, but also things like rice paddies. The only way to solve this cause of climate change is by no-till farming, expanding crop rotations, and combining livestock and vegetable production.
