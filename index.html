            What is climate change?
          </h1>
          <p>
            Climate change is the overall and long-term change in weather
            patterns around the world or just, in general, Earth’s climate. The
            changes can be in temperature, precipitation, water levels, water
            temperatures, natural disasters, and more. Weather changes usually
            vary from short periods of time such as months, days, or even hours,
            while the Earth’s climate changes over thousands or millions of
            years. An important concept to remember is that Earth’s climate
            naturally always changes since there have been times when the Earth
            was warmer and when it was cooler. The focus of this website is to
            explain how other factors, such as human activity, have been
            speeding up the natural process of climate change over the last
            hundred years.
